Hi everyone.

At first, my english is not good.

all files are copied from orignal Vaadin 7.1.12 source.

those java source files are:
com.vaadin.client.ui.table.TableConnector.java
com.vaadin.client.ui.VScrollTable.java

the appended this is where TestTableWidget.java:1076
===
                firstvisible = firstRowInViewPort;
===

I don't know these variables' mean.
I just searched around source codes and I just put above one line.

thanks.
